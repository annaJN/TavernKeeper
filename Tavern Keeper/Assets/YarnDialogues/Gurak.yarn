The Orc looks weathered and tired. 
You contemplate whether you should ask him to please put on a shirt, but he looks a little irrate. 
...plus he's twice your size, so maybe not.
-> "Hello, can I take your order?"
Orc: Yes. 
Orc: Ale. 
Orc: ...
Orc: ...Please.

Gurak: Where is my ale?
-> "Coming right up!"
(I can get an ale in the bar, and serve it by dragging it to him.)

The Orc looks tense, and is constantly glancing at the door. 
You put the ale down on the table. 
Greg: Ah, finally.
 -> "Uhm... That would be 5 slugs."
Gurak: Oh, yes, right. Of course.
Gurak: Wait...
Gurak: ...
The orc rummages through a bag by his feet, getting increasingly frustrated. 
Gurak: ...there.
<<GetMoney GameManager 5>>
Gurak: Here. 5 slugs.
-> "Have a nice evening."
